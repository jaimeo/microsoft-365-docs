# Step 1: Prepare your network for Microsoft 365

*This step is required and applies to both the E3 and E5 versions of Microsoft 365 Enterprise*

In Step 1, you must:

- Evaluate and adjust network bandwidth for internal links and Internet connections to account for traffic to Microsoft 365 Enterprise cloud services.
- Align your network with an [Office 365 reference architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/office-365-network-connectivity-principles#BKMK_P2).
- Plan the changes, pilot them, and then test whether the changes fit your bandwidth and traffic latency requirements.

As an interim checkpoint, you can see the [exit criteria](networking-exit-criteria.md#crit-networking-step1) corresponding to this step.
