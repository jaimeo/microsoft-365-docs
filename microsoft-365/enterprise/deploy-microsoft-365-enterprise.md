# Deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise

Microsoft 365 Enterprise is a combination of Office 365, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), and Windows 10 Enterprise that: 

- Has intelligent security.
- Is integrated for simplicity.
- Unlocks creativity.
- Is built for teamwork.

These benefits are not realized just by obtaining the licenses for the three products, but by deploying them and their features in a specific way that includes integration and state-of-the-art security.

There are two main ways to deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise:

- Do it with Microsoft engineers using FastTrack for Microsoft 365
- Do it yourself with the Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment guide

## FastTrack for Microsoft 365

FastTrack is an ongoing and repeatable benefit—available as part of your subscription—that is delivered by Microsoft engineers to help you move to the cloud at your own pace. FastTrack also gives you access to qualified partners for additional services. With over 40,000 customers enabled to date, FastTrack helps maximize ROI, accelerate deployment, and increase adoption across your organization. See [FastTrack for Microsoft 365](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/microsoft365).

If you want to take advantage of FastTrack to deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise, you can use the FastTrack [Microsoft 365 deployment advisor](https://aka.ms/microsoft365setupguide) for guidance on how to deploy and set up your foundation infrastructure. Note that you must be signed on as a global administrator in an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 tenant in order to access this page.

Get started on your end-to-end deployment journey with FastTrack [here](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/microsoft365).

## Microsoft 365 Enterprise deployment guide

The Microsoft 365 Enterprise Deployment Guide steps you through the end-to-end deployment so that when you're done, you have the correct and required configuration of Microsoft 365 Enterprise products and features.

To deploy Microsoft 365 Enterprise yourself:

- First, deploy the required [foundation infrastructure](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md) for built-in security and integration for simplified management, which makes it easier to ensure your client software is updated with the latest productivity and security enhancements.
- Next, deploy key productivity [workloads and scenarios](deploy-workloads.md) on top of the foundation infrastructure. These unlock creativity and teamwork in your organization.

Here's the relationship between the foundation infrastructure and the workloads and scenarios and your path through the content.

Get self-started on your end-to-end deployment journey [here](deploy-foundation-infrastructure.md).

## Take a test drive

“For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.” - Aristotle

If you're new to Microsoft 365 Enterprise or to a specific product or feature, one of the best ways to gain understanding is to build it out yourself and see it working.

We've made this easier with Test Lab Guides (TLGs), which step you through the configuration of infrastructure or a feature in a simplified but representative environment using trial or paid subscriptions.

With TLGs, you can self-learn, demonstrate, customize, or build a proof of concept of a complex configuration, workload, or end-to-end scenario.

For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Enterprise Test Lab Guides](m365-enterprise-test-lab-guides.md).
