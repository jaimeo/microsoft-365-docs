# Getting help for end users

There are two ways that users in your organization can get help with their Microsoft Managed Desktop devices: **Get Help** app, or phone support. Note that devices residing in the test ring are out of scope for these end user support options. 

## Get Help app

The preferred method for providing support to your users is **Get Help**, an easy to use interface built into the end user device.

This is an application that’s installed on all Microsoft Managed Desktop devices and is pinned to the task bar. 

- End users can request a call back to a provided phone number, or chat online with a service rep.
- Requests that fall outside of Microsoft Managed Desktop support scope are redirected to the local IT helpdesk via phone call.  

## Phone support

End users with Microsoft Managed Desktop devices also have access to toll-free phone numbers they can call. This is meant to be used when Get Help isn’t available. For example, if they can’t sign in to the device, or the device is broken. Here are the phone numbers for phone support:
 

- United States & Canada: +1 855 425 0216
- United Kingdom: +44 800 026 0698
- Australia: +61 180 037 0619
